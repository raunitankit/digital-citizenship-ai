# Student Handout — Build an AI Digital Citizenship Detector

## Your Mission
Create a small app that reads short messages/answers and estimates:
- Safe vs. Risky behavior
- Respectful vs. Disrespectful tone
- Toxicity and Scam likelihood

## Steps
1. Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`.
2. Paste your own example messages. Try to *confuse* the AI and record what happens.
3. Change the **labels** in `detectors.py` and see how the results change.
4. Write a short reflection: *When did the AI disagree with your judgment?*

## Challenges (Choose any)
- Add a slider to show messages above a toxicity threshold.
- Add a button: “Suggest a kinder rewrite.”
- Log all analyses to a CSV with timestamps.
