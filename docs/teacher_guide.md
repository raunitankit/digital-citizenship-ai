## Objectives
- Practice digital citizenship with AI-assisted reflection.
- Compare human judgment vs. AI estimates.
- Build a simple UI and discuss model limitations.

## Lesson Plan (45–60 min)
1. **Warm-up (5m):** What is safe vs. risky behavior online?
2. **Demo (10m):** Show the Streamlit app; run 2–3 examples.
3. **Hands-on (20m):** Students try their own texts; note disagreements with AI.
4. **Discuss (10m):** Why did AI mislabel anything? What signals matter?
5. **Exit Ticket (5m):** One improvement they’d make to the model or labels.

## Assessments
- Reflection paragraph: “When did AI get it wrong?”
- Small group share: propose improved labels or thresholds.

## Extensions
- Add a **threshold slider** for toxicity.
- Add a **rewrite** button that suggests kinder alternatives (rule-based or AI).
